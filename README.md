# Smart_Trashbin_with_ESP32_and_Losant

Smart Trashbin monitoring system presents a proof of concept where the system is used to monitor the trash level in the trash bins located across the city.

The system will generate data analytics and inform the user when it is time to empty the trash bins. The analytics generated can also be used to create an intelligent waste collection system that will create predictions and prepare route plans to collect waste as efficiently as possible.
